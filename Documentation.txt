Using Chrome webbrowser version 34 for speech recognition and speech synthesis to teach simple addition.

Target audience: my 5 year old daughter :)

How to use: Direct your webbrowser to https://mellerbeck.github.io/ (the https: 
is important, it allows you to answer the security question only once to allow chrome to access your microphone)

After the page loads, Click 'Amelia Addition' and then the Start Button

It will ask a question using speech synthesis. Answer the question i.e. what is 2 + 2

Say 4. If you get it correct it will let you know and then give you your next question.
