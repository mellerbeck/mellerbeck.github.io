CS50 Final Project

I thought it would be fun to experiment with voice recognition. Early on I ran into 
http://iambrandonn.github.io/FlashCards/ this was an excellent starting point!

I got a GitHub account and then copied everything over. GitHub is pretty cool
you can create a project with your username.github.io and then GitHub will host it for you!

So I read through Brandon's code, the last assignment on CSS\HTML\javascript was very useful
to trying to understand it. I removed some of the code that wasn't going to 
be needed for my simple implementation.

I read a lot about the google chrome voice recognition and people were compaining that the 
microphone would turn off at about 7 seconds if you didn't say anything. I ran into this
problem as well. The solution was to use https (so it wouldn't ask for access again to the
microphone) and then on the onend event restart the microphone. This worked sortof ok

Eventually I moved away from the implementation of voice recognition inside brandon's version.
I replaced it with annyang created by Tal Ater. This was almost a drop in replacement.
Using the javascript's library was nice it had code to handle the timeout of the camera, 
it would only restart if it was closed automatically. Plus it would not slam the browser
with restarts, it would only restart once a second. Using the library it recognition
was improved.
